# Simple-Interest-Calculator 📈

A simple frontend application — built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript — to calculate simple interest based on user input.

## ✅ What is this

This project allows you to quickly compute the simple interest (and optionally total amount) by providing:
- Principal amount  
- Interest rate (annual)  
- Time period (in years or months — depending on your UI)  

The calculator runs entirely in the browser (client-side), no backend required.

## 🧰 How it works / Features

- Clean and minimal UI using HTML + CSS  
- Interactive calculation using JavaScript — on input submit or button click  
- Validates user input (if you added any) before performing the calculation  
- Shows the result (interest and/or total amount) immediately  

## 📁 Project Structure

/ — root folder
|-- index.html — main HTML file
|-- style.css — stylesheet for layout & styling
|-- script.js — core JavaScript logic (calculation & DOM interaction)

##📈 What You Can Add / Improve (Ideas)

Input validation (e.g. prevent negative/zero values)

Support for different compounding intervals (if you want to become a compound-interest calculator)

More user-friendly UI (error messages, form reset, responsive design)

Option to output total amount (principal + interest)

Save history of calculations (in localStorage or similar)
